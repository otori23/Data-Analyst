Aside from Intro to data science class

1) Data types 
- Three basic types, numeric, categorical(ordinal), time series

2) Numerical Data (carry mathematical meaning)
- aka Quantitative data
- Two types 
- continuous (measurement, e.g., height, weight, take any value within a range, real numbers) and 
- discrete (counts, e.g., # home runs or hits, whole numbers, integers)

3) Categorical Data
- Represent characteristics
- e.g. position on team, which tean, hometown, handedness
- can take on numerical values, but the don't have mathematical meaning, i.e...
- can't perform mathematical operations on them add, take average, etc

4) Ordinal Data (Qualitative)
- in some sense a mix of Numerical and Categorical data
- Catergories with some order or ranking and can be compared i.e. ...
- rate a movie from 1(bad) - 5(good) 
- For plotting purposes ordinal data is treated as Categorical data

5) Time-series data
- Simply a collection of obervations obtained through repeated measurements over time
- Data collected via repeated measurements over time
- Data collected at regular intervals over a preiod of time
- Like numerical data with ordering based on time it was recorded
