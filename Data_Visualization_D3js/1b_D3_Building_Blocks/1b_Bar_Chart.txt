1) Working through part II of Mike Bostock's Let's Make a Bar Chart Tutorial.
http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/

2) svg group tag (<g>...</g>)
- analogous to <div> tag in html
- has no visual display, only serves to group that elements contained within it

3) Binding Data
- See the draw js function in the code from Bostocks tutorial
- 1st pass at parsing the code:

var bar = chart.selectAll("g")
  .data(data)
  .enter().append("g")
  .attr("transform", function(d, i) { return "translate(0," + i * barHeight + ")"; });

- select all the g tags in the svg element (i.e. selected by .chart)
- Note that initially there are no g tags, so the selection will be empty
- Using .data(), bind the data the function receives to the selected g tags (none for now)
- .enter() returns a sub-selection to the call to .data()
- .enter() returns a selection of every dataum (in data) that doesn't have a corresponding
g tag associated with it (i.e. data not placed on the page)
- Initially no g tags on page, so .enter() is return all the data points
- .enter().append("g") then means for every point in the data append a g element to the chart
- .attr() says for each of the "g" elements, set thier transform attribute to translate function
- the transform attribute is specific to svg elements
- Note, there are other kinds of selections besides .enter()
- bar = a bunch of g tags that have some transform applied to them
- at this point no visual elements have been placed on the web page
