1) Next Big Goal
- Recreate a visualization to improve it
- Learn principles to prototype and enhance/refine your graphics
- how to measure effectiveness of visualization

2) Visual Encodings 
- Think of as building blocks of graphics
- Compenents we can combine in creative ways to construct a visualization
- Think of as nouns, verbs, adjectives (i.e. parts of speech) of graphics
- parts of speech (pos) are to sentences as viusal encodings are to charts

3) Charts
- wikipedia says: Charts are graphical representation of data in which the data is 
represented by symbols

- such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart

4) POS analogy
- whlie there may be infinitely many ways to create a sentence with pos primitives, 
- in practice, there are a limited number of ways that make sense
- and an even smaller number that are used regularly
- This is due to constraints and rules of the language and grammar 
(i.e. the rules enforce certain constraints) 
- Also, it is easier to understand patterns that are familiar

6) Effective Chart Design
- Stephen Few article - Effective_Chart_Design.pdf
- Simplest solution is best

7) Common Chart Types
- Visual Encodings + Data Types + Relationship = Chart Types

- Scatterplots are great for showing two paired sets of values 
(for example, the heights and weights of people) to determine whether there 
is a relationship between them.

- A histogram requires binning of the data. In other words, the histogram shows 
the counts in each discrete interval of the continuous data. For example, the number 
of people between age 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91 and older.

8) Choosing Chart types
- instructor hass some issue with how the chart chooser is organized, and thinks some
chart types are missing

- When choosing a chart type he normally starts with
-- Data Type: Continuous or categorical
-- Dimension: 1D, 2D, 3D
-- Am I trying to compare two variables


-- Am I trying to show how one variable is distributed
--- Want to see distribution of 1D continuous data: historgram (with bins)
--- Want to see distribution of 1D categorical data: bar chart (x axis values have no intrinsic order)

- Am I trying to show a comparison of distributions
--- boxplot or small multiples - represent distribution of multiple variables side by side with each other

- Correlation of two variables
-- scatter plot (no dependency of values on x-axis)
-- as opposed to time-series data where there is an ordering of the values on the x-axis (show trend by connecting poitns with a line)
-- bubble chart is a generalization of scatter plot (bubble size shows additional dimension)

9) Small Multiples
- Also known as Trellis or Lattice plots
- A series of charts laid out in a grid
- Common data faceted by different categories
- Coined and popularized by Edward Tufte - pioneer in data visualization

10) Box Plots
- Visualize multiple distributions in one plot
- Invented by John Tukey - from the field of exploratory data analysis

11) Un/Stacked Bar Charts
- Shows proportions or comparisons
- If you have multiple categories and want to show how the magnitude of each compares to the others
- Also show how distribution changes over time between the categories

12) Chart Relationships
- bar chart: highlights individual values, supports comparisons, and can show rankings or deviations
- boxplot: shows distributions and quantiles, especially useful when comparing distributions
- pie chart: shows part-to-whole relationship and best suited for one category; poor for making comparisons
- stacked bar chart: shows part-to-whole relationship and best suited for showing composition within categories and totals
- bubble chart: shows how three or more sets of values vary; shows correlation
- line chart: shows overall changes and patterns, usually over equally spaced intervals of time
- map: values are encoded on physical locations and patterns may be drawn by comparing locations
- scatterplot: shows how two pair sets of values (for example height and shoe size) vary; shows correlation

13) Tables
- use when data does not have any inherent structure or order
- typical used to represent summaries of data or disjoint facts
- like a lookup mechanism

14) Map
- (x,y) + geographic context = Map

15) Other geographic charts
- Choropleth = geographic + color 	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map)
- Cartogram = geographic + size 	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram)
- Dot map = geographic + shape (http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics/Racial-Dot-Map)

17) Common Chart Types from Duke Introduction to Data Visualization Guide
- http://guides.library.duke.edu/vis_types

18) Many other decisions to be made in addition to choosing the right chart type

19) Pre-attentive Processing
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-attentive_processing
- Allows you to instantly recognize parts of a visualization
- Like using color to highlight the 9s in a matrix of #s - then wasy to count how many 9s
- pre-atentive pocessing occurs on the order of 200 - 250 milliseconds

20) Commonm pre-attentive attributes
- color (hue and stauration)
- form (i.e. shape)
- spatial position (something like orientation)
- Movement (i.e. using animation or make something flicker)
- Obviously can combine them if needed

21) Negative Space
- can also use for pre-attentive processing
- can use to encode missing data or values of zero

22) Color
- Don't use if it adds nothing or distracts
- Saying in design circles: "Get It Right in Black and White"
- Use less intense color - intense colors strain the eye
- Can use color to highlight something import in visualization
- Rules for using color by Stephen Few (rules_for_using_color.pdf)
- Cynthia Brewer's ColorBrewer (http://colorbrewer2.org/) assist in picking colors

24) Alberto Cairo (his book is "The Functional Art")
- Dude gets mentioned ALOT
- http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/about-book.html

25) Edward Tufte - on color in visualizations
- Indeed, so difficult and subtle that avoiding catastrophe becomes the first principle 
in bringing color to information: Above all, do no harm.

26) Gestalt Principles of Perception

- We organize what we see in particular ways to make sense of visual information. 
There are six principles that influence the ways human see and understand visuals.

-- PROXIMITY

-- SIMILARITY

-- FIGURE AND GROUND

-- CONTINUITY

-- CLOSURE

-- SIMPLICITY

27) Gestalt

- loosely translated in English means "shape" or "form"

- http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/gestaltprinciples/gestaltprinc.htm
- http://www.slideshare.net/luisaepv/the-gestalt-laws-of-perception

28) ChartJunk
- The term chartjunk was coined by Edward Tufte in his 1983 book, 
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.

- chartjunt = unecessary visual encodings

- when designing you visualization you think about what to put in AND what to leave out

29) Grid Lines in Graphs
Grid Lines in Graphs by Stephen Few (grid_lines.pdf)

30) Data to Ink ratio
- the data-ink ratio is defined as the ratio of the amount of ink used to 
describe the data to the amount of ink in the graphic.

- high data to ink ratio is good

- low data to ink ratio is bad - to may unecessary elements in visualization

- The example that Ryan covers comes from Dark Horse Analytics.
(http://darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/data-looks-better-naked/)

31) Lie Factor
- Created by Edward Tufte
- Describes the integrity of a graphic
- or how well a graphic represents its underlying data
- Size of the effect shown in the graphic / size of the effect shown in the data
- 0.95 < lie-factor < 1.05
- calculate the denominator and numerator as: (|second val - first val|/first val) * 100

32) Jitter
- can be thought of as noise in the collection or presentation of the data.
- can also be introduced to data values to reduce overplotting and is generally 
useful in the exploratory data analysis phase.
- http://zevross.com/blog/2014/05/05/unhide-hidden-data-using-jitter-in-the-r-package-ggplot2/

33) Percentage Change
- subtract the old from the new, then divide by the old value. Show that as a Percentage.

34) The Grammer of Graphics
- Separate content from aesthetics

- Grammar to make thinking and reasoning about graphics and charts easier

- Defines a set of best practices for developing and iterating on a data visualization

- Developed by Leland Wilkinson in the late 1990s
(http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448)

- Hadley Wickham's A Layered Grammar of Graphics
(layered-grammar.pdf)

35) Why Separate content from aesthetics
- Separately think about visual elements and structure of data
-- transform data without changing visual representation
-- allow for collaboration across teams

36) D3's implementation of the theory (i.e. specification) of the Grammar of Graphics
- NOTE: R's ggplot2 is also an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics specification
- NOT: D3 not a charting library, but step below, ie building blocks for a charting library
- start with raw data in a file (my-data.json)
- as we go through the pipeline of the grammar of graphics
- apply a different transformation to the data at each step
- i.e. from Source (in file) -> .......-> Graphic (rendered on web page in browser)

37) The pipeline
- source (i.e. json file) -> |d3.json()| -> variables (i.e. array of js objects, [{}, {}, ...])
- d3.nest -> groups our data
- d3.scale -> transforms a continous or categorical variable into 
something that a web page can display i.e pixel value, or color
- d3.layout -> a convinence function that allows us to apply a common 
transformation according to a set of predefined chart layouts that we 
might want (i.e pie chart, histogram, or graph)
- d3.append -> add svg or html elements to DOM
- d3.attr -> changes some attribute of whatever we are appending
- use style attribute or css selectors to add aesthetics to graphic
