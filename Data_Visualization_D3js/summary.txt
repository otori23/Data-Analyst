1) Graphic Design Principles

2) When you encounter a visualization ask yourself:

- how do I classify this visualization (i.e. what type of chart/map/whatever is it?)
- what are the visual encodings ?
- what is the narrative structure ?
- what visual elements are helping you interpret the graphic ?
- how can i improve/iterate on the visualization ?
