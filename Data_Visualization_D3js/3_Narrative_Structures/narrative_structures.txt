0) You should know
- Design Principles
- How to compose graphics

1) Now what?
- We want to understand some narrative strutucers we can use to walk our viewers through our visualizations
- Baiscally primitives for how to define a context in which your graphic has meaning and makes sense

2) Traditional Journalism
- What appraoches do they take when creating their stories
- Nate Silver's view: quantitative <-> qualitative; Rigorous & emperical <-> Anecdotal & ad-hoc
- http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/
- both dimensions are orthogonal and create 4 quadrants (journalism_map.jpeg)
- bottom two quadrants are trash
- this course focuses on techniques used by organizations that occupy the upper left quadrant
- i.e. 538

3) Correlation vs Causation
- Correlation does not imply causation

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation#Examples_of_illogically_inferring_causation_from_correlation

4) In Math Speak
- Correlation: A and B
- Causation: A -> B

5) Traditional Jounalism			
- data around narrative				
- narrative is primary; data is secondary and supporting role
- start with article, and have static chart for support
- linear structure to story
- delivery mechanism: physical or static (i.e. static html)

6) Data Journalism
- narrative around data
- data is primary; narrative is secondary
- start with dataset; and write a story about what is happening in the data set
- interactive charts showing data 
- labels, annotations, and side bars to add context to the data	
- interactivity allows for more complex story lines that are not necessarily linear
- delivery mechanisim: interactive using open web technologies

7) Misconceptions
- Data visualization is not just about the end visualization
- 90% of the work is data munging
- the last step is the visualization

8) Getting and cleaning data
