0) You should know
- Design Principles
- How to compose graphics

1) Now what?
- We want to understand some narrative strutucers we can use to walk our viewers through our visualizations
- Baiscally primitives for how to define a context in which your graphic has meaning and makes sense

2) Traditional Journalism
- What appraoches do they take when creating their stories
- Nate Silver's view: quantitative <-> qualitative; Rigorous & emperical <-> Anecdotal & ad-hoc
- http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/
- both dimensions are orthogonal and create 4 quadrants (journalism_map.jpeg)
- bottom two quadrants are trash
- this course focuses on techniques used by organizations that occupy the upper left quadrant
- i.e. 538

3) Correlation vs Causation
- Correlation does not imply causation
- http://www.tylervigen.com/
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation#Examples_of_illogically_inferring_causation_from_correlation

4) In Math Speak
- Correlation: A and B
- Causation: A -> B

5) Traditional Jounalism			
- data around narrative				
- narrative is primary; data is secondary and supporting role
- start with article, and have static chart for support
- linear structure to story
- delivery mechanism: physical or static (i.e. static html)

6) Data Journalism
- narrative around data
- data is primary; narrative is secondary
- start with dataset; and write a story about what is happening in the data set
- interactive charts showing data 
- labels, annotations, and side bars to add context to the data	
- interactivity allows for more complex story lines that are not necessarily linear
- delivery mechanisim: interactive using open web technologies

7) Misconceptions
- data visualization is not just about the end visualization
- 90% of the work is data munging
- the last step is the visualization

8) The Reality
- 90% of the time spent creating a data visualization is actually spent "finding the data, verifying the data, parsing the data, filtering the data, and exploring the data." This is certainly true in the context of data science and when trying to answer questions with data. 

9) Getting and cleaning data
- the data journalism handbook: http://datajournalismhandbook.org/
- getting data section: http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data.html
- five minute field guide:
http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_0.html
- getting data from the web:
http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_3.html

10) Verifying Data
- When it comes to verifying data, it is up to you to know the data inside and out, including the data's source, collection methods or other data generating processes.

11) EDA Tools
If you've ever tried cleaning up a messy data set, you know that data processing and manipulation can be cumbersome.
- OpenRefine: http://openrefine.org/
- Google Spreadsheets: http://www.google.com/sheets/about/
- iPython Notebook: http://ipython.org/notebook.html
- Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/
- Pandas Example: 
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fonnesbeck/pytenn2014_tutorial/blob/master/Part%201.%20Data%20Wrangling%20with%20Pandas.ipynb
- R: http://www.r-project.org/

12) Once you have the data you need, you're ready to create a visualization.

13) How to lie with bar charts
- your eyes just notices the end pts on the bars (and thus their difference in length)
- can make small changes look really big; when you don't use a zero reference
- so, you bar charts must have a zero base line
- must see the entier bar for accurate context

14) Lying with Charts
- Save the Pies for Dessert by Stephen Few (save_the_pies_for_dessert.pdf)
- Check our some other graph remakes and learn more about using plot.ly.

16) Types of Bias
- There are three types of bias of which you should be aware when constructing graphics: 
- author bias
- data bias
- reader bias

17) Author bias
- the designers and presenters of the visualizations (knowing or unknowingly) misrepresented data through visual encodings or other design choices such as the chart type

- as the designer or presenter of data visualizations, your design choices should establish trust between the reader and the graphic

- your design choices should facilitate communication

- otherwise, you risk the overall credibility of your message among readers

18) Data bias

19) Reader bias
