0) You should know
- Design Principles
- How to compose graphics

1) Now what?
- We want to understand some narrative strutucers we can use to walk our viewers through our visualizations
- Baiscally primitives for how to define a context in which your graphic has meaning and makes sense

2) Traditional Journalism
- What appraoches do they take when creating their stories
- Nate Silver's view: quantitative <-> qualitative; Rigorous & emperical <-> Anecdotal & ad-hoc
- http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/
- both dimensions are orthogonal and create 4 quadrants (journalism_map.jpeg)
- bottom two quadrants are trash
- this course focuses on techniques used by organizations that occupy the upper left quadrant
- i.e. 538

3) Correlation vs Causation
- Correlation does not imply causation
- http://www.tylervigen.com/
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation#Examples_of_illogically_inferring_causation_from_correlation

4) In Math Speak
- Correlation: A and B
- Causation: A -> B

5) Traditional Jounalism			
- data around narrative				
- narrative is primary; data is secondary and supporting role
- start with article, and have static chart for support
- linear structure to story
- delivery mechanism: physical or static (i.e. static html)

6) Data Journalism
- narrative around data
- data is primary; narrative is secondary
- start with dataset; and write a story about what is happening in the data set
- interactive charts showing data 
- labels, annotations, and side bars to add context to the data	
- interactivity allows for more complex story lines that are not necessarily linear
- delivery mechanisim: interactive using open web technologies

7) Misconceptions
- data visualization is not just about the end visualization
- 90% of the work is data munging
- the last step is the visualization

8) The Reality
- 90% of the time spent creating a data visualization is actually spent "finding the data, verifying the data, parsing the data, filtering the data, and exploring the data." This is certainly true in the context of data science and when trying to answer questions with data. 

9) Getting and cleaning data
- the data journalism handbook: http://datajournalismhandbook.org/
- getting data section: http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data.html
- five minute field guide:
http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_0.html
- getting data from the web:
http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_3.html

10) Verifying Data
- When it comes to verifying data, it is up to you to know the data inside and out, including the data's source, collection methods or other data generating processes.

11) EDA Tools
If you've ever tried cleaning up a messy data set, you know that data processing and manipulation can be cumbersome.
- OpenRefine: http://openrefine.org/
- Google Spreadsheets: http://www.google.com/sheets/about/
- iPython Notebook: http://ipython.org/notebook.html
- Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/
- Pandas Example: 
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fonnesbeck/pytenn2014_tutorial/blob/master/Part%201.%20Data%20Wrangling%20with%20Pandas.ipynb
- R: http://www.r-project.org/

12) Once you have the data you need, you're ready to create a visualization.

13) How to lie with bar charts
- your eyes just notices the end pts on the bars (and thus their difference in length)
- can make small changes look really big; when you don't use a zero reference
- so, you bar charts must have a zero base line
- must see the entier bar for accurate context

14) Lying with Charts
- Save the Pies for Dessert by Stephen Few (save_the_pies_for_dessert.pdf)
- Check our some other graph remakes and learn more about using plot.ly.

16) Types of Bias
- There are three types of bias of which you should be aware when constructing graphics: 
- author bias
- data bias
- reader bias

17) Author bias
- the designers and presenters of the visualizations (knowing or unknowingly) misrepresented data through visual encodings or other design choices such as the chart type

- as the designer or presenter of data visualizations, your design choices should establish trust between the reader and the graphic

- your design choices should facilitate communication

- otherwise, you risk the overall credibility of your message among readers

18) Data bias
- systematic measurement errors or faulty devices can bias raw data values
- selection bias can lead to subgroups that are not representative of the population of interest for a given question - data bias and sampling methods are beyond the scope of this class
- however, we encourage you to learn more about these topics:
-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection
-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods
-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics)

19) Reader bias
- encompasses any preconceived notions or assumptions that a reader brings to interpreting a visualization
- the assumptions may pertain to a reader's domain knowledge or the topic of the data visualization
- other assumptions may involve political, religious, or cultural beliefs 
- or a reader's familiarity with a specific chart type 
- you should always consider your audience's background and familiarity with graphics when designing a data visualization

- both the designer (encoder) and the reader (decoder) ought to be aware of bias
- communication can go awry due to the designer's choices or the reader's interpretation of a graphic

20) Personal Data Visualization
- visualizations tell a subjective story
- http://aprilzero.com/ by Anand Sharma
- http://feltron.com/
- the sites are just examples of good looking web/graphic design

21) Traditional story telling (i.e. traditional narative structure)
- introduction -> rise in action -> climax -> fall in action -> final resolution -> the end
- works will in a variety for formats: oral, written stories, TV and movies
- rise of new mediums (computers, internet) has given rise to new narative structures
- these new narrative structures can be more complex

22) Author-Driven Narrative
- have a well defined start and end point
- procedes in a linear flow that is directed by the quthor of the visualization

23) View-Driven Narrative
- have a well defined start point
- allows user the freedom to choose the direction in which the nrarrative progresses
- the story will end in different places for different users
- depends on the choices users make along the way

24) Author-Driven vs. User-Driven
- author driven
-- strong ordering
-- heavy messaging
-- need for clarity and speed

- view driven
-- ask questions
-- explore 
-- tell your won data stories

25) Author-Driven example
- Visualizing the Syrian Refugee Crisis by Wesam Manassra
http://visual.ly/visualizing-syrian-refugee-crisis?view=true

- The Facebook Offering: How It Compares by the New York Times
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html?_r=0

- note that they quote the data sources the used
- the progression of the story is fixed, i.e. by time

26) View-Driven example
- user freely interacts with data and creates their own story

- San Francisco Crimespotting by Stamen Design
http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/

- Paths to the White House by the New York Times
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html

27 Martini Glass visualization (a more complex narrative structure)
- like a hybrid of author and view driven narrative
- starts out as author driven, then morphs into user drive
- think of the shape of a martini glass on its side (martini_glass.jpeg)

28) Martini Glass visualization examples
- drone strikes (http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/)
- gun deaths (http://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013)

29) Narrative structure summary (analyzing the narrative structure of visualizations)
- as you create your won visualizations, try to decide on which narrative structute you want to use
- when you consume a visualization, ask youself the following
-- what is the narrative structure ?
-- how does the visualization lead you through the data ?
-- what is the story being told ?
-- how could this have been improved ?
